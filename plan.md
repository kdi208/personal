I. Design Philosophy: "The Computational Oracle"
* Aesthetic: CLI / Terminal Brutalism. The site should look like a functional tool, not a marketing brochure. It implies you are "under the hood" of reality.
* Color Palette: Deep void black background (#000000), Phosphor Green (#39FF14) or Amber (#FFB000) for text. High contrast.
* Typography: Monospaced fonts (e.g., JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or IBM Plex Mono).
* Interaction: Fast, keyboard-navigable, minimal animations (unless they are data visualizations).

II. Site Architecture (Single Page Application)
The site should flow logically from High-Level Vision → Technical Proof → The Architect.
1. The Hero Section: The "Terminal" 


* Visual: A blinking cursor. Text types out automatically upon load.
* Headline: > INITIALIZING COMPUTATIONAL GOVERNANCE...
* Sub-Headline: > ARCHITECTING THE CIVILIZATIONAL KERNEL.
* Status Bar:
    * LOCATION: SAN FRANCISCO
    * STATUS: BUILDING PHASE I (OUROBOROS)
    * HORIZON: 50 YEARS
* Interactive Element: A background animation of a Voronoi diagram or cellular automata (Game of Life) that reacts to the mouse, symbolizing "simulation as a search algorithm".
2. The Manifesto: "The 50-Year Plan"
* Concept: This acts as the filter. If they read this and think you are crazy, good. If they get it, they are your target.
* Format: A collapsible timeline (JSON tree structure style).
* Content:
    * [YEARS 1-7] PHASE I: OUROBOROS – Agentic Modeling for Macro-Strategy.
    * [YEARS 8-15] PHASE II: NEXUS – The Corporate Digital Twin.
    * [YEARS 16-30] PHASE III: INFRASTRUCTURE – Vertical Integration / "The Mirror".
    * [YEARS 31-45] PHASE IV: THE KERNEL – Global Clearinghouse for Intent.
    * [YEARS 46-50] PHASE V: STEWARDSHIP – Constitutional AI Governance.
* CTA: A download button for the "Civilizational Kernel Manifesto" PDF.
3. The Lab: "Proof of Competence"
This is the most critical section to prove you are an engineer, not just a "Suit".


* Project A: The Dopamine Agent (Live Sandbox)
    * Description: "Reinforcement Learning agent with biological reward prediction error parameters."
    * Visual: Embed your Streamlit or React app directly here.
    * Features: Show the "Neuro-State Dashboard" and the "Wirehead Mode" button clearly.
    * Caption: "Modeling probabilistic human behaviors within a deterministic rules engine".
* Project B: Sigil AI / Micro-Kernel
    * Description: "Multi-agent simulation where autonomous 'Patient' and 'Clinician' agents stress-test clinical workflows".
    * Link: Link to the GitHub Repo.
4. The Architect: "The Source Code"
This replaces the standard "About Me." It reframes your legal background as "Systems Engineering."
* Headline: > DECOMPILING THE RULES ENGINE
* Copy:"I spent a decade auditing the source code of civilization (Law & Economics). I modeled risk for $18B in M&A deals and drafted algorithmic policy for the U.S. Congress. Now, I translate those legal constraints into agentic logic.".
* Key Skills (displayed as a code block):JSON{
*   "domain": ["Corporate Law", "Macro-Economics", "Mechanism Design"],
*   "stack": ["Python", "LangChain", "RAG Pipelines", "React"],
*   "current_focus": "Multi-Agent Orchestration"
* }
* 
5. Footer: The Signal Check
* Text: > EVERYTHING IS COMPUTABLE. JOIN THE SEARCH..
* Links: GitHub | LinkedIn | Email (dino.ilievski@gmail.com).

III. Copywriting Strategy (The "Hook" Scripts)
Use the "Pitch Scripts" from your strategy document as the headers for your blog/research posts to capture the specific audience types.


* Blog Post 1: "Why the World Doesn't Need Another Metaverse: It Needs a Prediction Engine."
* Blog Post 2: "Reframed: Deconstructing the 'Rules Engine' of the Economy."
* Blog Post 3: "The Dopamine Agent: Coding Addiction into AI."

IV. Recommended Tech Stack
To maintain the "Engineer" signal:


* Framework: Next.js (React) – Shows you can build modern web apps.
* Styling: Tailwind CSS – For rapid, clean UI development.
* Animation: Framer Motion (for smooth UI transitions) or Three.js (if you want a 3D visualization of the agent network).
* Hosting: Vercel (Standard for Next.js) or GitHub Pages (Shows you live in the repo).
